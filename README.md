Adding Common Sense to Artificial Intelligence.

READ THIS!!! THIS IS PRE-ALPHA.  Download the code, see if it compiles, try it out a bit. Help files and documentation will be coming soon. 
TO AVOID FRUSTRATION, DO NOT edit this code without first contacting the Future AI Society "https://futureaisociety.org".  This project is a migration from a much larger commercial endeavor and there is a likelihood that whatever you want already exists and hasn't been migrated yet.

I appreciate your interest in this project and hope your experience will be positive. There are many ways to participate at all levels of AI ability. As a first-timer, you can download a release, try things out, report any bugs, and make a few suggestions. At the other end of the spectrum, you can dive into the code, create modules and training sets. and more.

**Brain Simulator 3** is a free, open-source software project aimed at adding common sense to  Artificial Intelligence. The design philosophy is based on:
1. we cannot have adult-level common sense without first investigating and implementing the capabilities of a young child
2. information in the brain is arranged in a graph of nodes connected by edges (with numerous other features)
3. our Universal Knowledge Store (UKS) can store and retrieve any concepts the human mind can create

Although not migrated yet, the **Brain Simulator** implements an artificial entity named “Sallie” who lives in a simulated world and can integrate input from multiple senses. She can recognize objects with binocular vision and associate them with words she hears, plan a sequence of actions, and manipulate objects to achieve a goal. As she advances to understanding her world, interfaces already exist for cameras, microphones, and robotic control to bring AGI to life.

Again, thanks for your interest!
Charlie Simon, originator of the Brain Simulator
